To conclude, the present research presented the evaluation of the SVM and XGBoost models for the detection of negation cues using various features as described by Chowdhury et al. (2012) and Lapponi et al. (2012) \cite{chowdhury2012fbk, lapponi2012uio}, using the SEM 2012 SharedTask CD-SCO dataset. The study aimed to determine the performance of the models in detecting negation cues and their scope, which is essential for obtaining reliable insights from text data. The results of the ablation analysis provided insights into which features are most relevant for negation cue classification.


the study found that both SVM and XGBoost models performed well in predicting negation cues. However, SVM was slightly more accurate in detecting the scope of negation cues. The study also found that the token feature had a significant impact on the models' performance. Nevertheless, the dataset used in this study was imbalanced, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Future research should aim to address this limitation by using a more balanced dataset. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that SVM and XGBoost models, with the appropriate features, can effectively predict negation cues, providing a foundation for accurate insights from text data.


Overall, this study contributes to the development of robust and effective negation detection systems, which can benefit various applications in natural language processing and text analysis.
