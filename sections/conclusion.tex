To conclude, This paper presented the development of two machine learning algorithms, namely XGBoost and SVM, 





In conclusion, this study presented the development of a machine learning-based negation detection system, using a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. The system was evaluated on the SEM 2012 circle test set, and the results showed that both SVM and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy and F1 score, with SVM performing slightly better.


However, the error analysis revealed some limitations and weaknesses of the models in handling complex negation cases, such as multi-word cues and context-dependent negation. These findings suggest that further research is necessary to improve the models' capabilities, such as exploring more advanced features, incorporating contextual information, and utilizing more extensive training datasets.


Nonetheless, the developed system has significant potential applications in various fields, including natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and medical text analysis. For example, in medical text analysis, the ability to detect negation can help identify the absence of medical conditions or treatments, which can be critical in improving patient safety and care.


Overall, this study contributes to the development of robust and effective negation detection systems, which can benefit various applications in natural language processing and text analysis.
