Negation detection is a crucial task in natural language processing as it helps in understanding the sentiment and context of a statement. In this study, we evaluate four machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and XGBoost with and without Random Over Sampling, for negation detection in text data. The performance of the models was evaluated on two datasets, and it was found that the models did not differ significantly in terms of performance. The results suggest that the imbalance in the dataset does not solely contribute to the poor performance of the models, and the models themselves may not be capable of detecting the negation pattern completely. The study also highlights the need for future research to consider training the models on more balanced datasets and to explore ways to avoid the reliance of the model on a single feature, such as a list of negation expressions.
