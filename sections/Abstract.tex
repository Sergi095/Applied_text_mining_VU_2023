This paper presents a comparative study of two machine learning models, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and XGBoost, for detecting negation cues in text data. Negation cues can significantly impact the meaning of a sentence, and their accurate detection is crucial for obtaining reliable insights from text data. The study evaluates the performance of the models in detecting negation cues and their scope using an ablation analysis. The results show that both SVM and XGBoost models perform well in detecting negation cues, with SVM slightly outperforming XGBoost. The findings of this study can aid in the development of more accurate natural language processing tools for text data analysis. However, the limitations of the study, such as the imbalanced dataset, suggest the need for further research in this area.
